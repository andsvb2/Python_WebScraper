<h2>Explorer</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Library Reference</a> section contains a lot of necessary information, but sometimes it is difficult to understand where everything is. Today is the time to be an explorer. Go down the page and you will see the sections headings: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Introduction</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Built-in Functions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Built-in Constants</a><br/>
	...</li>
</ul>
<p>Your task is to look at some of them and select the appropriate statements about them. This will help you to learn how to navigate the documentation structure.</p>
